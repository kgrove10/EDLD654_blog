<h3>Description of Random Forest Model</h3>
<p>To understand a random forest model, we first have to understand its building blocks, decision trees. Decision trees can be used for either regression or classification problems (here, we’re using them to address a regression problem of predicting student scores). A decision tree is essentially a series of splits in the data, where is split at a series of nodes based on the feature that makes the separated groups to as different as possible from each other (this feature at this first split is called the “root node”). Data from either side of this split are then split again on the next feature that makes that data as different as possible, and so on (so called interior nodes) until you reach some terminal number of observations (the leaf, or terminal node). Thus, given an observation, you can move through this decision tree based on the features of that observation and the splits to predict some result (regression or classification).</p>
<p>A random forest model uses decision trees in aggregate…</p>
<p>A random forest model is a machine learning model that combines many decision trees into one model. What is a decision tree? (high level explaination of what model is doing and why it is appropriate).</p>
<p>We selected this model because (explain)</p>
<p>This model makes the following assumptions (list).</p>
<p>We will evaluate the performance of this model using… (list).</p>
