This post will do the following:

- Compare and contrast the three different model fits, including a discussion of model performance. 
- Share code to communicate our procedures, and discuss our final model selection and the evidence that led us to this selection.

- Random forest: rmse = 85.8138947197454, rsq = 0.452623773165699, computation time (on talapas) = 22911.134 seconds (to tune and fit).

NOTE: we should probably put in some mention of the fact that we all computed predictions based on the test.csv dataset, because of the computational intensity of several of our datasets, in order to ease submission once we had selected the best model based on rmse. (just to increase our transparency!)

Finally, we will will also submit our final model predictions from your final model to kaggle so that a quantitative indicator of prediction accuracy can be provided.
