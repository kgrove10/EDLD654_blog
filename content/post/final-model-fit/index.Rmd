This post will do the following:

- Compare and contrast the three different model fits, including a discussion of model performance. 
- Share code to communicate our procedures, and discuss our final model selection and the evidence that led us to this selection.

- Random forest: rmse = 85.8138947197454, rsq = 0.452623773165699, computation time (on talapas) = 22911.134 seconds.

Finally, we will will also submit our final model predictions from your final model to kaggle so that a quantitative indicator of prediction accuracy can be provided.
