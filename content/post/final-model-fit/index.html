<p>Compare and contrast the different fits, including a discussion of model performance. Share code to communicate your procedures, and discuss your final model selection and the evidence that led you to this selection.</p>
<p>You will also need to submit your final model predictions from your final model so that a quantitative indicator of prediction accuracy can be provided.</p>
