<p>This post will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compare and contrast the three different model fits, including a discussion of model performance.</li>
<li><p>Share code to communicate our procedures, and discuss our final model selection and the evidence that led us to this selection.</p></li>
<li><p>Random forest: rmse = 85.8138947197454, rsq = 0.452623773165699, computation time (on talapas) = 22911.134 seconds.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we will will also submit our final model predictions from your final model to kaggle so that a quantitative indicator of prediction accuracy can be provided.</p>
