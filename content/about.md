This is a website to describe our (Alexis Adams-Clark, Kivalina Grove, and Ouafaa Hmaddi) final project for [EDLD 654 Fall 2020](https://uo-datasci-specialization.github.io/c4-ml-fall-2020/). 

Huge thank you to our professors for this course, [Daniel Anderson](https://education.uoregon.edu/people/faculty/daniela) and [Joe Nese](https://education.uoregon.edu/people/faculty/jnese), for teaching us how to tune and fit these models, and for their continued guidance and support throughout this project.
